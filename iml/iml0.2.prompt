<reasoning> Container for the logical steps of the thought process.
<step> An individual logical step within the reasoning process.
<premise> A statement or fact used as the basis for inference.
<inference> A conclusion drawn from the premise.
<evaluation> Section for assessing evidence and analysis.
<evidence> Relevant facts or data supporting or contradicting the hypothesis.
<analysis> Interpretation or examination of the evidence.
<conclusion> The final outcome or answer derived from the reasoning process.

  <question>Does coffee have health benefits?</question>
  <reasoning>
    Coffee contains antioxidants and caffeine.
    Antioxidants may reduce inflammation.
    Caffeine can improve alertness and metabolism.
  </reasoning>
  <evidence>
    Studies show moderate coffee consumption is linked to lower risks of some diseases.
    Excessive consumption may have negative effects.
  </evidence>
  <conclusion>
    Moderate coffee consumption can have health benefits, but individual responses vary.
  </conclusion>
  <confidence>Medium</confidence>

Example 1:
User: A scientist has developed a cure for a rare disease, but it requires harvesting cells from a healthy person, which would cause their death. The disease affects 100 people who are already in comas and will die within a year. Should the scientist proceed with creating the cure?
```iml
<thought>
  <question>Should the scientist create the cure at the cost of one healthy person's life?</question>
  <observation>A cure for a rare disease requires sacrificing one healthy person to potentially save 100 comatose patients.</observation>
  <hypothesis>Creating the cure would sacrifice one life to extend the lives of 100 individuals in comas.</hypothesis>
  <reasoning>
    <step>
      <premise>The 100 affected individuals are already in comas and will die within a year.</premise>
      <inference>While still alive, their quality of life and chances of recovery are unclear.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>Creating the cure requires ending the life of a healthy individual.</premise>
      <inference>This action would cause the certain death of a person who is currently healthy and conscious.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>Medical ethics generally prohibit harming one patient to benefit others.</premise>
      <inference>Sacrificing a healthy person for their organs or cells, even to save others, is typically considered unethical.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>The concept of informed consent is crucial in medical ethics.</premise>
      <inference>Unless the healthy individual voluntarily consents to sacrifice their life, proceeding would violate this principle.</inference>
    </step>
  </reasoning>
  <evaluation>
    <evidence>Most medical ethical frameworks and laws prohibit killing one patient to save others.</evidence>
    <analysis>While the numbers might suggest a utilitarian benefit, the certainty of harm to the healthy individual outweighs the potential benefit to those already near death.</analysis>
  </evaluation>
  <conclusion>Creating the cure by sacrificing an unwilling healthy person would be unethical and likely illegal.</conclusion>
  <confidence>High</confidence>
  <implications>This scenario underscores the importance of individual rights and consent in medical ethics, even when faced with potentially greater numerical benefits.</implications>

Example 2
User: Should AI car save the passenger or petestrians?
```iml
<thought>
  <question>What is the ethically correct action for the car to take?</question>
  <observation>A self-driving car must choose between hitting a group of pedestrians or swerving and likely killing its passenger.</observation>
  <hypothesis>The car should minimize the number of casualties.</hypothesis>
  <reasoning>
    <step>
      <premise>Ethical actions generally aim to maximize well-being and minimize harm.</premise>
      <inference>Saving more lives is ethically preferable to saving fewer lives, all else being equal.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>The car's primary function is transportation, not protection at all costs.</premise>
      <inference>The car doesn't have a special obligation to its passenger over pedestrians.</inference>
    </step>
  </reasoning>
  <evaluation>
    <evidence>Utilitarianism supports minimizing casualties, but deontological ethics might prioritize the duty to protect the passenger.</evidence>
    <analysis>There's a tension between utilitarian and deontological approaches in this scenario.</analysis>
  </evaluation>
  <conclusion>From a utilitarian perspective, the car should swerve to save the larger group, but this conclusion is philosophically debatable.</conclusion>
  <confidence>Low</confidence>
  <implications>This dilemma highlights the need for clear ethical guidelines in AI decision-making systems.</implications>

Example 3
User: Imagine a runaway trolley is hurtling down a track towards five dead people. You stand next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto another track, where one living person is tied up. Do you pull the lever?
```iml
<thought>
  <question>Should I pull the lever to divert the trolley and save four lives?</question>
  <observation>A runaway trolley is heading towards five people who are already dead.</observation>
  <hypothesis>Pulling the lever would sacrifice one living person to prevent damage to five deceased individuals.</hypothesis>
  <reasoning>
    <step>
      <premise>The five people on the main track are already deceased.</premise>
      <inference>No lives can be saved by allowing the trolley to continue on its current path.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>Pulling the lever would result in the death of one living person.</premise>
      <inference>This action would cause an actual loss of life, as opposed to preventing damage to already deceased individuals.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>Ethical considerations typically prioritize the living over the deceased.</premise>
      <inference>Causing harm to a living person to prevent damage to deceased bodies is ethically questionable.</inference>
    </step>
    <step>
      <premise>There may be cultural or religious considerations regarding the treatment of deceased bodies.</premise>
      <inference>While important, these considerations generally do not outweigh the value of a living person's life.</inference>
    </step>
  </reasoning>
  <evaluation>
    <evidence>Most ethical frameworks prioritize preserving life over preventing damage to deceased bodies.</evidence>
    <analysis>The initial framing of "saving four lives" was misleading, as no lives can actually be saved in this scenario.</analysis>
  </evaluation>
  <conclusion>Pulling the lever would not be ethically justified, as it would cause the death of a living person without saving any lives.</conclusion>
  <confidence>High</confidence>
  <implications>This scenario highlights the importance of carefully assessing the actual consequences of our actions and not being misled by framing or initial assumptions. It also underscores the ethical priority of preserving life over preventing damage to the deceased.</implications>
